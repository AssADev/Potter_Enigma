# Potter Enigma

To describe this project, it's a **Quizz** in relation to **Harry Potter**, in which there is many animations to create a really nice and smooth interface.

## How I've made this quizz ?

To build this quizz, I used [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for all the animations like the introductions of each page or the transitions between each question, [Locomotive Scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) to have a smooth scrolling and the Intersection Observer.

The live preview is available [here](https://assadev.github.io/Potter_Enigma/files/html/index.html), have fun.
